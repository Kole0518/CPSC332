            I am relatively familiar with JS, but
            I have not used it nearly as much as
            CSS or HTML. This is the part of web dev
            that I have the least experience with.

            I didn't really find anything surprising
            in this class about JS. I already knew what it can
            be used for. I am definitely looking forward to learning
            about using JavaScript to make cool special effects!
